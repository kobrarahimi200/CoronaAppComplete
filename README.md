we will create a COVID-19 Tracker/Stats Application. We're going to use React with the addition of Charts.js, Material UI, and many different modules. 

Corona Virus is, unfortunately, spreading through the entire world. What can we, as developers, do to make the situation better? We can help to spread awareness by visualizing the data. The data is fetched from the API and we'll create cards displaying the statistics as well as Charts. This project/application is created using the most modern JavaScript syntax. 


Running App:
In order to run the application, you can download the whole folder and open it in Vistual Studio code IDE and run it through npm.
